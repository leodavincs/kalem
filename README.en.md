# Kalem

[Türkçe](README.md) | **English**

> Every scene has its own pen.

## New: plate engine (levha)

Takes a machine designed in code (lever, pulley system, crank-piston, gear train), draws it like a Leonardo notebook plate, builds it stroke by stroke, runs its parts on their joints and turns it into a teaching video. The blue technical-drawing style needs no Codex and runs entirely in code.

Details and the one command: [motorlar/levha](motorlar/levha/README.en.md)

When you ask an AI to make a video with code, the results all look alike, because every scene is drawn with the same engine. **Kalem** ("pen" in Turkish) is a Claude Code skill that splits your video into scenes, looks at what happens inside each one and picks the engine that draws it best. It then renders each scene with that engine, joins them with transitions such as a page flip, and adds sound effects locked to the frame.

You describe what you want. The skill decides which pen draws which scene.

## New: the referans skill

Give it a video you like. It splits it into scenes and writes a separate video prompt for each one: camera angle and movement, light, what moves, how long it lasts. It does **not** generate video; you do that in your own video tool. No API key needed, Claude looks at the frames itself (ffmpeg required).

```
claude
/referans ~/Desktop/myvideo.mp4
```

Output in `projeler/referans-<name>/`: `istemler.html` (three frames per scene, short Turkish notes, English prompt, copy button) and `istemler.md`. Example from Méliès' *A Trip to the Moon* (1902, public domain): [`ornek/referans-melies/`](ornek/referans-melies/istemler.md). Limits: use it for reference, do not copy other people's videos; Claude sees three frames per scene, not sound or fast motion.

## Which scene, which engine

| Inside the scene... | Engine |
|---|---|
| A line that draws itself, a sketch | Paper.js |
| A character, walking, one shape morphing into another | Plain canvas |
| Explosions, light, dust, thousands of particles | PixiJS |
| Text, numbers, counters, info cards | HyperFrames (HTML + GSAP) |
| Real 3D: orbiting camera, light, shadow | Three.js |
| Formulas, graphs, diagrams | Manim |
| A running machine as a notebook plate, teaching video | Levha (`motorlar/levha`) |

Helpers: Matter.js and Rapier (physics), gl-transitions (125 transitions incl. page flip), Tone.js (frame-locked sound effects), Anime.js, tsParticles, glTF-Transform.

The table reflects one person's taste: 20 tools raced on the same scene and were scored by eye. Run your own tests and change it. It lives in `.claude/skills/kalem/SKILL.md`. The skill and its prompts are written in Turkish; Claude follows them in any language.

## Install

Needs macOS or Linux, Node 20+, Python 3, ffmpeg, Google Chrome and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). Manim is optional.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leodavincs/kalem.git
cd kalem
./kurulum.sh
```

## Use

Open Claude Code in the repo folder and describe your video:

```
claude
/kalem A 50-second landscape video about Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine...
```

Claude first shows the scene table (scene, engine, why) and waits for your approval, then renders every scene in its own folder, checks the frames and joins them into `projeler/<name>/cikti.mp4`.

Manual join: `python3 birlestir.py projeler/<name> --gecis BookFlip --etiket` (`--etiket` stamps a small card naming the engine on each scene).

## How it works

- Time comes from the frame number; randomness is seeded, so the same command gives the same frames.
- Browser engines are captured frame by frame in Chrome (`ortak/yakala.py`), not recorded in real time, so heavy scenes never stutter.
- Each scene writes `olaylar.json` (a line starts, something drops, a wing flaps). Sound is generated from that list, so it never drifts from the picture.
- Scenes are independent and can be rendered in parallel.
